## Comparison of equally valid trees

An analysis of whether multiple equally valid phylogenetic trees produced by
distance-based methods (eg UPGMA) are actually close with negligible
differences, or actually very different. Intended as a continuation of
the [2022 paper by Segura-Alabart et al. in *Brief Bioinf*](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/5/bbac312/6652780).

#### Test data
`test_trees.nwk` contains trees from fig. 1A of the Segura-Alabart paper (lines 1 and 3)
and a rerooting of first tree (line 2).

`Thai_2007.nwk` and `Karatas_2019.nwk` are two small-ish tree sets from the same paper.
(106 and 108 trees, respectively)
