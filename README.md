## Comparison of equally valid trees

An analysis of whether multiple equally valid phylogenetic trees produced by
distance-based methods (eg UPGMA) are actually close with negligible
differences, or actually very different. Intended as a continuation of
the [2022 paper by Segura-Alabart et al. in *Brief Bioinf*](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/5/bbac312/6652780).
